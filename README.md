# Infosys-BizHacks-Hackathon-2023

A healthcare application that facilitates interaction between patients, hospitals, pharmaceutical companies, and medical professionals.
This project is a modified version of open-source software developed by https://github.com/cbartram/ChatBot

New intents/utterances were designed to match and improve the application using Wit.ai


Future Implementation of this project:- 
1. _Blockchain_ can be introduced to secure the medical data of patients
2. _Machine Learning_ will be used to analyze the medical data that can facilitate better medical solutions which can help doctors diagnose a particular chronic disease and implement better research approaches in the medical industry.
3. A smartwatch paired with the Medsister application helps patients set reminders for taking their medicines at a particular interval.
